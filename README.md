These Java files are from my previous Java programming class, using three distinct components: client, server, and line searcher. The setup allowed users to employ a graphical user interface (GUI) for a document, searching for specified lines of text corresponding to the number of lines they provided. Utilizing server connections and GUI elements, the code was able to have a seamless execution. It established connectivity with the client side, enabling users to input the desired line for retrieval. This allowed the user to continuously input lines they want retrieved and the server would be able to continue giving it to the client.
