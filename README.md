# Assignment from Advanced Java Programming COP 2805C
These Java files are from a past Java programming class, incorporating three key components: client, server, and line searcher. This configuration allowed users to utilize a graphical user interface (GUI) to navigate documents, searching for specified lines of text based on the provided line count. Through the integration of server connections and GUI elements, the code is executed seamlessly, establishing connectivity with the client side. This enabled users to input desired lines for retrieval continuously. The server was capable of consistently delivering requested lines to the client. The outcome included the specified line and the subsequent four lines, providing users with contextual information regarding the location of the text within the document.
